# From Concept to Deployment

This project is a part of the Full Stack Web & App Bootcamp at [WBS Coding School](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/). The goal of this project was to transform a Figma wireframe into a fully functional website using HTML and CSS, set up a project repository on GitHub, manage changes through pull requests, and deploy the site using GitHub Pages.
